"""
The Unofficial Guide — the same pipeline, over HTTP.

    python serve.py                          run it locally on port 5000
    gunicorn serve:app                       run it the way a host runs it

Nothing new happens in this file. It is a wrapper: a request comes in, it
hands the question to `app.py::ask_pipeline` — the exact function the command
line uses — and hands the answer back as JSON. Retrieval, the relevance gate
and the grounded prompt all still live where they lived. If you change how
your system answers, you change it in those files and this one follows.

Two routes:

    POST /ask       {"question": "..."} in, the answer and its sources out
    GET  /health    is the service up, and is there an index to search

Why this exists: `app.py` runs once and exits, which is fine on your laptop
and impossible to deploy. A hosted service has to stay up and wait for
requests. This is the smallest thing that does that.

⚠️ There is deliberately no logging, no timing and no metrics in this file.
Week 9 has you build the structured log yourself — the request line, the
timing field everyone skips, the whole instrument-before-you-deploy exercise.
Shipping a logger here would hand you the answer to that. Add yours in week 9;
this file stays the bare shell until then.

    Two different questions, and the second one is the one that bites. A

    returns "no index" — hosts give you no disk that survives a restart, so
    the index has to be built as part of getting the service up. Checking
